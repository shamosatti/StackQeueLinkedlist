Stack?

Add item : Push ->
Remove item: Pop ->
See the top item: Peek  ->
Add 10, 20, 30   ->
Pop : Removes 30   ->
Peek : Shows 20 

Key Purposes:
Shows how to add, remove, and view items using the Last In, First Out (LIFO) method.
The last item added is the first one to be removed.

Queue?

Add item: Enqueue ->
Remove item: Dequeue  ->
See the first item: Peek  ->
Add 1, 2, 3  ->
Dequeue  Removes 1  ->
Peek : Shows 2

Key Purposes:
Shows how to add, remove, and view items using the First In, First Out (FIFO) method.
The first item added is the first one to be removed.

Time Complexity
Stack Operations (push, pop): O(1) – Fast because we always work with the top item.
Queue Operations (enqueue, dequeue): O(1) – Fast because we always work with the front item.

HOW its work?
Copy the code into a file (e.g., stack_queue.py).
Run the file.
The program will show how Stack and Queue work with examples.
